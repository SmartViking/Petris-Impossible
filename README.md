Petris Impossible
======

Petris, including all 12 *free* pentominoes. However, you can flip the pentominoes with the 'F' key, accessing all 18 *one-sided* pentominoes! Adapted from [MaTris](https://github.com/SmartViking/MaTris). Licensed under the GNU GPLv3. Works with both Python 2 and 3.

Run `python petris.py` to start the game. Good luck.
